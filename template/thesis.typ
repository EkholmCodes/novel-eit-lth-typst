The equations above are @divergence and @ampere-maxwell. This is @intro but below is @test and below that is @test2. This chapter can be found on #ref(<intro>, form: "page").

Above @figureB is next to @figureC. By using the #raw("#flex-caption(long caption, short caption)", lang: "typst", block: false) function you can make flexible captions. You can also make longer/shorter headings! See @flexHeading on #ref(<outline>, form: "page").

= A word on Typst referencing

On #ref(<ref>, form: "page") you can find links. @latex-guide provides a guide for past LaTeX users on the differences between the two typesetting languages, including what's native or not native, which macros map to which function etc. @cite and @bibliography links to information on how to cite and reference different sources. Typst includes support for both its native YAML-based format and BibTeX. @universe gives a link to the Typst Universe. On this page you can find packages which aid in your workflow, both in terms of styling and automation. Zap for example is used to make circuit diagrams much like TikZ. @zap

For documentation on all functions, markup- and styling commands, see @documentation.
